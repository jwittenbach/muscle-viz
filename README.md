# med-viz

The purpose of this project is to provide open source, useful, and usable
tools for the visualization of clinical findings. The hope is that intuitive
tools will be time-saving and frustration-easing for medical students, 
residents, fellows, and attendings in an academic medical setting.

The first tool will allow for intuitive viewing of muscle weakness. This will 
replace or be used as an adjunct to the traditional two column format when 
presenting muscle weakness. Such a visualization tool will allow the 
presenter to quickly and easily display their findings to others involved 
in patient care. The format may also be useful to provide plots for case 
reports; it will provide the reader an easy method to see patterns of weakness 
across patients with similar conditions. The tool could also be useful 
if saved in the patient's chart, thus allowing for a time series of 
weakness.
